<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

This is a repository of my (Jose Nicolas Mora) completion of the [MDN Accessibility Troubleshooting Assessment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Accessibility_troubleshooting).

In this project we are presented with a fictional nature site displaying an article about bears. The original webpage has multiple accessibility issues, and my task was to explore the existing site and fix several of them.

The website was tested for accessibility using the [NVDA screenreader tool](https://www.nvaccess.org).

- Skip to main content link.
